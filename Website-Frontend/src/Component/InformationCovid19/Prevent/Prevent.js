              <h3>Check body temperature </h3>
              <p>
                On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with
                the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14
                days. So, regularly check your body temperature to prevent a
                pandemic.

              <h3>Regularly clean the place</h3>
              <p>
                Cleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or
                detergent reduces the amount of germs on surfaces and decreases
                risk of infection from surfaces. So you should regularly clean
                the place.

              <p>
                Human-To-Human Contact Is The Most Common Way That A Person With
                COVID-19 Can Infect Other People. To Limit Exposure, Health
                Organizations Are Urging People To Keep Safe Distances From Each
                Other And Avoid Touching Others.!!!

              <p>
                Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of
                respiratory and diarrheal infections from one person to the
                next.

              <p>
                COVID-19 vaccines can help end the pandemic. They are a key
                first step to end the COVID-19 pandemic so we can get back to
                doing the things we enjoy, with the people we love.

              <h3>Wear A Face Mask</h3>
              <p>
                A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out
                particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air,
                reducing the chances of infection.
